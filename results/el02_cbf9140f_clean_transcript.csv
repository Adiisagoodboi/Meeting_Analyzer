SPEAKER_00,Fascinating,0.46,55.46,"Technology has changed how we think, live, and even talk.  It's fascinating to realize that a few decades ago, people didn't have smartphones or the internet.  Now, everything is connected.  We can talk to anyone in seconds, see faces from across the world,  and even teach machines to understand emotions.  The artificial intelligence is everywhere, in phones, speakers, even cars.  It's exciting, but sometimes a little scary too.  I often think about where this is going.  Will machines ever understand us completely?  Maybe not feelings, but they are getting closer every day.  It's like living in a sci-fi movie, it's real life now."
