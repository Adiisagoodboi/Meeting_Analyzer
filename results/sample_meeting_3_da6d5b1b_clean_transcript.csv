SPEAKER_01,Rahul,10.48,31.12,"and let's stick to the agenda. Hi everyone, Rahul here. I've finished the homepage redesign  and uploaded the files on Figma. I also created a mobile version.

SPEAKER_00,Speaker,69.6,90.0,"Oh, right, sorry. I tested the contact form and found two bugs. The email validation isn't  working properly and the submit button sometimes freezes. I've logged both in Jira. I'll handle  the validation bug myself, but the submit issue may need back and support. Yeah, I noticed the validation"

SPEAKER_00,Speaker,96.88,108.8,"deployment. Absolutely, I'll handle it. By the way, I think the site could look more appealing if we  added some animations to the homepage. I saw some really cool ideas online."
SPEAKER_02,Anita,109.84,116.48," Animations are nice, but they're not our priority. First, we need the core features working smoothly."
SPEAKER_03,Priya,116.48,123.84," Exactly. We can consider animations once the main modules are stable. Fair enough, I'll focus on"

Rahul has completed the login and sign-up flow  with the OAuth pending from IT. Karan tested the forms, found two bugs, and will fix validation.
